#### With All My Heart Part 1: Completely Recreated Cuteness

----

*__In the student council room__*

__Sena__: Fufu, I have the ultimate ingredients.<br />
__Sena__: Kotone, I will make the best chocolate for you!

__Misuzu__: Oh...President Sena.

__Sena__: Oh, Misuzu. Didn't you already go home?

__Misuzu__: I came back to get some items I forgot. Are you making chocolate?

__Sena__: Yes, I'm making a prototype for the actual day.<br />
__Sena__: After thinking about how to convey my feelings to Kotone-<br />
__Sena__: I decided to make a Kotone.<br />

*__In Sena's fantasy__*

K: ...this is how I look from the President's perspective. It's so cute~â™¡<br />
K: If the President produces me, I wonder if I'll shine as an idol...?

*__Back in reality__*

__Sena__: -it's perfect.

__Misuzu__: What's perfect?

__Sena__: No, nothing.

__Misuzu__: Still, you've captured the characteristics of Kotone clearly.

__Sena__: I guess so! When it comes to Kotone, I can't be beat.

__Misuzu__: However-the mouth here. It might be better to raise it a little.

__Sena__: Eh!? Where!?<br />
__Sena__: T-That's true. Her mouth became plumper and cuter. Then the cheek here will be even more-<br />
__Sena__: Misuzu, there are other thing I would like your opinion on... Oh, she's gone.<br />
__Sena__: When that girl leaves, she's like a ninja.

#### With All My Heart Part 2: Made with Love

----

*__In the student council room__*

__Sena__: Misuzu, have you been giving chocolates to Tsukimura Temari as long as you've known her?

__Misuzu__: Yes. Every year, I give something handmade.

__Sena__: What kind of chocolates have you made so far? I would like to hear them as a reference.

__Misuzu__: ...is that right.<br />
__Misuzu__: Mari-chan love sweets, but she's always holding back.<br />
__Misuzu__: But on Valentine's Day, she doesn't need to worry...<br />
__Misuzu__: I want her to eat the chocolate. So first, I make a menu.<br />
__Misuzu__: I'll write down many calories she should consume before and after Valentine's day.<br />

__Sena__: By regimenting the food before and after, idols can enjoy chocolate too-!

__Misuzu__: And...<br />
__Misuzu__: You have to be careful with how much of dairy products you use, so you can prevent pimples.

__Sena__: That's wonderful ingenuity. It conveys your feeling for the person you are giving it to.<br />
__Sena__: -thank you, Misuzu.<br />
__Sena__: I won't be defeated either.<br />
__Sena__: First, regarding Kotone's ideal menu, I'll talk to a nutritionist.<br />
__Sena__: Wait for me! Kotone! [*runs out of the room*]<br />

__Misuzu__: ...she left. I'm a little worried, but...<br />
__Misuzu__: Fufu...I wonder what will happen.
