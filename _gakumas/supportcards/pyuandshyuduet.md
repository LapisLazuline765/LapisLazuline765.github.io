*__On the running trail__*

__China__: Shyu..., it is difficult~! Put it on your mouth and blow it...<br />
__China__: Fueee there is grass in my mouth~~! It is bitter~~~!

__Temari__: ...what are you doing, eating a leaf?

__China__: Ahh! Tsukimura-san!?<br />
__China__: Y-you are misunderstanding! In class, we learned that you can use your breath to play a grass flute-<br />
__China__: I happened to see one, so I blew on it and it got in my mouth...

__Temari__: So you were eating it after all.

__China__: It was an unexpected accident!!

__Temari__: Fu. Suddenly eating grass on the side of the road, is just like a rabbit, no?<br />
__Temari__: Rabbit(usagi)...China...Usachina...?

*__In Temari's fantasy__*

__China__: It's China, pyonâ™ª Munch munch on leaves, they are delicious, pyon!

*__Back in reality__*

__Temari__: ...China-pyon.

__China__: C-China-pyon!?

__Temari__: China-pyon, do you like carrots?

__China__: China-pyon loves carrots! It's not like I like or dislike vegetables.<br />
__China__: Wah-that is not right! I meant to say **I** like carrots.<br />
__China__: Also! Can you please call me China as usual?<br />
__China__: It is not that I do not like China-pyon , but...

__Temari__: I like how cooly you call me China.

__Temari__: Hmm...C-China. The grass flute, let's play it together.

### Pyu and Shyu Duet Part 2: Dawn of Spring Sleep

---

*__On the running trail__*

__China__: Well...a dandelion bud.<br />
__China__: Spring is approaching...!<br />
__China__: [*yawns*]

__Temari__: Did you stay up late?

__China__: I am sorry. I feel  sleepy...sleepy...sleepy.<br />
__China__: Last night, I went to be early...[*yawns*]<br />
__China__: I also got very sleepy during class, especially during mathematics...!

__Temari__: I understand.

__China__: You get it, right?

__Temari__: I'm always getting up early in the morning to train, but I don't like it.<br />
__Temari__: Even though classes make me sleepy, I'm stubborn so I try not to fall asleep.<br />
__Temari__: I can't afford to lose to someone who is slacking off and taking naps during class.

__China__: Maybe you are referring to Hataya-san?

__Temari__: Yes. ...is Misuzu still skipping now?

__China__: Yes...! Student council, classes, lessons, before I know it she has already left...<br />
__China__: Recently, when Hanami-san spots her, she bring her along!

__Temari__: Ume will bring her...? Misuzu...?

*__In Temari's fantasy__*

__Misuzu__: I'm in trouble...Ume-san is good at hide and seek.

*__Back in reality__*

__Temari__: -that sounds good for Misuzu.<br />
__Temari__: [*to herself*] Just show me how serious you can be, Misuzu.
