*__In Saki's Room__*

__Saki__: Gunununununu~~~~~! <br />
__Saki__: It's frustrating, it's frustrating~~~~~!!<br />
__Saki__: After Ume joined, she's been relying on more people than just myself.<br />
__Saki__: That in itself is a very good thing, though.<br />
__Saki__: Not just friends in class, recently, it's also been the student council...gununu...<br />
__Saki__: That's right! It's February!<br />
__Saki__: I have to make the best Valentine's Day chocolate and show off my older sister abilities!

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Rinami__: ...[*humming*]fu~nfufu~~n♪<br />
__Rinami__: Sh, Saki-chan, do you want to use the kitchen?

__Saki__: Yes, Himesaki-senpai. Are you perhaps making chocolate?

__Rinami__: Yes, Valentine's Day is soon. Saki-chan, are you making chocolate too?

__Saki__: That's right! I think I'll try making a prototype to give to Ume.

__Rinami__: So, if you would like, why don't we make it together? There are still ingredients left over, what do you think?<br />
__Rinami__: Saki-chan, you are good cook, right? I head it from Ume.<br />
__Rinami__: That you are the older sister she's proud of. 

__Saki__: -!<br />
__Saki__: [*thinking*]*Proud, older sister!!*<br />
__Saki__: Fufu-if you are asking me to, it can't be helped.<br />
__Saki__: Leave it to Hanami Saki!!

__Saki__: Chocolate-like this!

__Rinami__: ...eh!? S-Saki-chan? This chocolate is rainbow colored-

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Rinami__: I see~. Ume-chan is relying less on her older sister?

__Saki__: That's right. So for Ume, I want to make the best chocolate.

__Rinami__: I see, I see. I really understand that feeling.<br />
__Rinami__: After all the work I put into it, I want them to be happy with the result.

__Rinami__: By the way, the chocolate you make every year for Ume-chan, what kind is it?

__Saki__: Something with high cacao concentration, to activate her brain during exams.<br />
__Saki__: Adjusting according to the sport she is training on and if she is trying to lose weight or not.<br />
__Saki__: I make it with my sister in mind!

__Rinami__: I've only ever thought about the had the taste before, I see, the nutrients are important too...<br />
__Rinami__: Saki-chan, you are amazing! I can feel your love for Ume-chan.

__Saki__: You understand! That's right~~~♡

__Rinami__: Fufu. Ume-chan, right? Even in the student council, she talks about her older sister all the time.<br />
__Rinami__: "I've done this with my older sister; This is what my older sister is good at."<br />
__Rinami__: She really loves Saki-chan.

__Saki__: Ehehe~~~~~~♡ Is that so~♡ What a perfect older sister I am~♡

__Rinami__: Fufu. Ah! That's right!<br />
__Rinami__: How about we talk about what Ume-chan is like in the student council again sometime?

__Saki__: Is it okay!? Thank you very much!!

__Rinami__: [*thinking*]*Saki-chan and Ume-chan both-*
__Rinami__: [*thinking*]*When they talk about each other, they are so cute♪*
