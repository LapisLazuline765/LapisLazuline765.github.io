*__In the producing room__*

__Hiro:__ Producer, producer.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want you to teach me how to cook.

__Producer:__ What kind of food do you want to make?

__Hiro:__ Today's Producer is buying into it too fast. Normally you are like ...<br />
__Hiro:__ [*doing an impression of Producer*] "-That's sudden. What are you planning on doing today?"<br />
__Hiro:__ That's what it's usually like. While giving me a look.

__Producer:__ Every time... in the end I end up doing your requests, so I'm cutting out an unnecessary conversation.

__Hiro:__ ...that's not good.<br />
__Hiro:__ I think you should enjoy conversations with the idol you've been working with.

__Producer:__ Fu- that's blunt. So, what are you planning on doing today?

__Hiro:__ ...fufu. I can't say yet. I would like you to teach me how to cook.

__Producer:__ ...

__Hiro:__ Producer has...lovely wrinkles between his eyebrows.

__Producer:__ So...what kind of food do you want to make?

__Hiro:__ Hm-...umm...huh.<br />
__Hiro:__ "What I really want to make" cannot be taught.<br />
__Hiro:__ But I want to improve my poor cooking. Something easy and quick.<br />
__Hiro:__ I hope I can do something about my skills.

__Producer:__ I understand now. Let's try making a lot of things.

__Hiro:__ If you make a lot of various things...even if you don't know "what I really want to make".<br />
__Hiro:__ I might be able to get learn it? Maybe I can learn a similar cooking method to what I need?

__Producer:__ There is also that... Overall...<br />
__Producer:__ I want you to improve your cooking skills.

__Hiro:__ Is it because...you want to eat my homemade cooking?

__Producer:__ Because cooking training is difficult.

__Hiro:__ ...you found out.

__Producer:__ Of course, I knew it.<br />
__Producer:__ It remind me of the first time I heard "supplementary lessons".

__Hiro:__ That is...a good memory. It was fun, wasn't it?

__Producer:__ I almost had to put restrictions on my idol's activities.

__Hiro:__ Fufu, it was very close. This is how I like to live though, right?

__Producer:__ I don't like to hear things like that.<br />
__Producer:__ Not being able to finish your classes in not a hobby.

__Hiro:__ That's right. It's just as you said.<br />
__Hiro:__ Producer, I...I'll seriously learn how to cook.<br />
__Hiro:__ I'm in your care.

*__In the producing room__*

__Producer:__ So...starting tomorrow, special cooking training-

__Hiro:__ Today.

__Producer:__ Huh?

__Hiro:__ Today. Special training.

__Producer:__ Hmm, you did as "as soon as possible". So let's start today.

__Hiro:__ Yeah.

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Ume:__ Fufufufu! That's a shame, Producer-san!

__China:__ I've heard about it- Shinosawa-san.

__Ume:__ Today! You can't use the communal kitchen♪

__Hiro:__ Producer, we can't use it.

__Producer:__ ...umm.

__Ume:__ This is the only kitchen on campus that students can use freely!<br />
__Ume:__ You can't use it♪

__Hiro:__ Fufuf, what should you do, Producer? We're in trouble.

__Producer:__ We are in trouble... Hanami-san, Kuramoto-san, can I ask why?

__Ume:__ Yes! That's right-<br />
__Ume:__ What was it, China-chan?

__China:__ Already...Hanami-san. We just had a meeting about it.<br />
__China:__ Yes, the reason you should not use this place is-...<br />
__China:__ ...why was it?

__Hiro:__ China, Ume. This way.

[*the girls huddle in the corner as Hiro whispers to them*]

__Ume:__ ...hmmm.

__China:__ ...I remember now.

[*the girls return to Producer*]

__China:__ Please listen, Producer. Hanami-san and I are-<br />
__China:__ in a fight with Shinosawa-san!

__Producer:__ Just now, you were having a friendly secret conversation...

__China:__ Ufufu, I do not know what you are referring too.

__Ume:__ We are in a fight, right~? Hiro-chan.

__Hiro:__ Yes...we are in a fight until tomorrow.

__Producer:__ Until tomorrow... A set end date.

__Hiro:__ The fight will be settled with a cooking contest.

__China:__ I will not forget it!

__Ume:__ So Producer!<br />
__Ume:__ Today we will be using the kitchen to do some cooking training-<br />
__Ume:__ You can't use it♪

__Hiro:__ Now, what should we do Producer?<br />
__Hiro:__ Maybe there is another place we can do our secret training.

__Producer:__ Ah...there isn't. Unfortunately, we have to give up for today.

__Hiro:__ ...I know a good place.<br />
__Hiro:__ Producer's house.

*__In Producer's house__*

__Hiro:__ ...here, this is where Producer lives.<br />
__Hiro:__ Fufu, I've always wanted to see it.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...no matter how close you are with me.<br />
__Hiro:__ You've haven't brought back the idol you are working with.

__Producer:__ ...this is the result of a clumsy strategy that destroyed our other options. 

__Hiro:__ Producer is also guilty, he fell for such a strategy. 

__Producer:__ [*doing an impression of Hiro*]"That's right... It's as you said."

__Hiro:__ Fufu, that's an imitation of me.

__Producer:__ Is the part about you wanting to improve your cooking skills true?

__Hiro:__ Yes.

__Producer:__ In that case, it's not the time to make small talk. Let's start some special training right away-

__Hiro:__ [*walks around the apartment*] Hmmm...ohoho...it's all tidy. Very like Producer.

__Producer:__ -please don't explore my room when I'm saying things like that.

[*Hiro walks back to Producer*]

__Producer:__ Good. Now while cooking there are four things to be mindful of.<br />
__Producer:__ Make it: according to the recipe. To taste. On time. And concentrate.

__Hiro:__ I already knew that, but then China and Ume start doing something interesting.<br />
__Hiro:__ I feel like I have to join in. And it's so much fun.

__Producer:__ I guess it is.

*__Later__*

__Hiro:__ ...grilled eggs, finished. It's a little burnt, though.

__Producer:__ It turned out delicious. You can cook after all, right?

__Hiro:__ ...have I already won your stomach?

__Producer:__ That's too arrogant.

---

*__Later__*

__Hiro:__ ...pancakes, finished.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...my skills have grown. I'm going to be able to use a knife soon.

__Producer:__ Please stop talking nonsense.<br />
__Producer:__ You need to first acquire the grip strength of a normal person.

__Hiro:__ ...that reaction was different than I expected.
__Hiro:__ This is...good.

---

*__Later, outside the dorms__*

__Hiro:__ -Producer. Thank you for today.

__Producer:__ You are welcome. The "what I really want to make" thing...<br />
__Producer:__ Do you think you can make it now?

__Hiro:__ Yes...<br />
__Hiro:__ The experience I gained will surely be useful. <br />
__Hiro:__ Umm, Producer.<br />
__Hiro:__ I'll have something to give you on February 14th.<br />
__Hiro:__ Please, accept it then.
