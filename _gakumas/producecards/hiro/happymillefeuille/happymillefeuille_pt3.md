*__In Producer's house__*

__Hiro:__ ...here, this is where Producer lives.
__Hiro:__ Fufu, I've always wanted to see it.
__Hiro:__ ...no matter how close you are with me.
__Hiro:__ You've haven't brought back the idol you are working with.

__Producer:__ ...this is the result of a clumsy strategy that destroyed our other options. 

__Hiro:__ Producer is also guilty, he fell for such a strategy. 

__Producer:__ [*doing an impression of Hiro*]"That's right... It's as you said."

__Hiro:__ Fufu, that's an imitation of me.

__Producer:__ Is the part about you wanting to improve your cooking skills true?

__Hiro:__ Yes.

__Producer:__ In that case, it's not the time to make small talk. Let's start some special training right away-

__Hiro:__ [*walks around the apartment*] Hmmm...ohoho...it's all tidy. Very like Producer.

__Producer:__ -please don't explore my room when I'm saying things like that.

[*Hiro walks back to Producer*]

__Producer:__ Good. Now while cooking there are four things to be mindful of.
__Producer:__ Make it: according to the recipe. To taste. On time. And concentrate.

__Hiro:__ I already knew that, but then China and Ume start doing something interesting.
__Hiro:__ I feel like I have to join in. And it's so much fun.

__Producer:__ I guess it is.

*__Later__*

__Hiro:__ ...grilled eggs, finished. It's a little burnt, though.

__Producer:__ It turned out delicious. You can cook after all, right?

__Hiro:__ ...have I already won your stomach?

__Producer:__ That's too arrogant.

*__Later__*

__Hiro:__ ...pancakes, finished.
__Hiro:__ ...my skills have grown. I'm going to be able to use a knife soon.

__Producer:__ Please stop talking nonsense.
__Producer:__ You need to first acquire the grip strength of a normal person.

__Hiro:__ ...that reaction was different than I expected.
__Hiro:__ This is...good.

*__Later, outside the dorms__*

__Hiro:__ -Producer. Thank you for today.

__Producer:__ You are welcome. The "what I really want to make" thing...
__Producer:__ Do you think you can make it now?

__Hiro:__ Yes...
__Hiro:__ The experience I gained will surely be useful. 
__Hiro:__ Umm, Producer.
__Hiro:__ I'll have something to give you on February 14th.
__Hiro:__ Please, accept it then.
