*__In the school lobby__*

K: Ugh, it's cold...
K: It's completely winter already... Christmas preparations are starting.
K: ...huh? What is this? There are more flyers.
K: "Christmas even scheduled at a cake shop. Are you looking for part time work...?"
K: The concept is cake made by idols!? Wah, so that's how they are gonna sell them~.
K: But, but, how much can be made...
K: !!!
K: I can't wait to do this! Christmas is amazing~~!! [*runs out past Lilija*]
L: That scared me... I wonder what happened with Kotone-chan?

*__At the cake shop__*

CSO: Umm, and you are Kotone Fujita?
K: Yes♪
CSO: Thank you for applying, but I'm sorry...
K: Is there something wrong?
CSO: You are the only applicant, it would be tough if we didn't have two more people.
CSO: So this time, I'll have the close the store and cancel the event.
K: [*thinking*] *W-w-what!? This is such a good paying part-time job!*
CSO: Even though you applied, I'm sorry.
K: [*thinking*] *No way, just like this...wait!*
K: Umm, that just means we need to get two more people, right?
CSO: Of course, if you can do that I'll open the story. ...can you do it?
K: I'll ask my friends!
K: [*thinking*] *I won't miss this chance~!!*
K: [*thinking*] *In fact, that the job pays this well will mean someone will want to do it!*

*__In a classroom*__

K: -and that's what happened, so won't you both join me?
S: I won't do it! I want you to train during that time!
T: I feel the same. You can't waste any time.
K: You answered so quickly!? Well, I had a feeling...
T: [*whispering*] ...and if we were making cakes, I'd probably want to eat some.
K: Ah~ For Temari, that might be a serious issue...
T: Huh? What was that? There is no way you understand what I have to go though!
K: [*thinking*] *Ah, dealing with her is still such a pain~!*
K: Yes, yes, I'm sorry, Temari. I was wrong (insensetive)!
T: T-that's right... As long as you understand, it's fine.
T: [*thinking*] *Even though I got mad... Kotone is so nice.*
K: So, for Saki, are you sure it's impossible?
K: The pay for this part-time job is really good...
S: I already figured that.
S: But I still refuse. Cake is not an idol's food.
K: [*thinking*] *Ah, still as conscious about that as ever~!*
K: Okaaaaay... I'll try asking some other people.
K: [*thinking*] *As expected, these guys rejected it. But I have lots of friends!*

*__Later, in a classroom*__

CMA: Huh, part-time job? Sorry! I have plans for Christmas!
CMB: I would like to say yes to your request, but I'm planning on spending this year with my family.
K: Is-is that right~ Well, have a fund Christmas~.

*__Later, in the courtyard__*

K: I-i'm out of options~~!?
K: Oh, you are all so dumb... Don't you want the money...
K: It won't end like this... I'll become woman who is very rich!
K: At this point, anyone will do! We don't even have to be close!
K: [*thinking*] *...huh? I feel like maybe I forgot someone?*
???: [*very quietly*] U-umm...
K: Well, no matter. Anyway, let's get back out there-!
L: A-ah, she left...
S: Ahaha, it's because you are too quiet, Lilija~
S: You want to do the cake shop part-time job, right?
L: ...yeah.
S: Then, I'll go and look for Kotonecchi♪
