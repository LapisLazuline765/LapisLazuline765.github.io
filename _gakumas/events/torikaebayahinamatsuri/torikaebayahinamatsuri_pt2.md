*__Outside a shrine__*

C: Oh~! So this is the venue for the festival!
T: China, don't get to work up. Remember we are here for work.
C: Ah! That is right!
C: The meeting for the Hinamatsuri festival should be done properly...!
T: That is correct.
M: [*thinking*] *Temari seems to be worked up herself just a moment ago...
M: ...ahem. It looks like they are in the middle of setting up the venue. Shall we look for management?

*__Later, outside the shrine__*

C: Eh!?
T: We...
M: ...will be in a play?
Management Staff: That's right! The play is based off the Hinamatsuri festival and it lasts at most 10 minutes!
MS: So? Will you guys do it?
M: ...u-umm...there is not much time left until the festival, right?
MS: Well~, it's a bit of a sudden request, but let's have fun with it.
MS: What do you think?
M:  ...we understand. We will do it.

*__Later, in the training room__*

M: [*thinking*] *...a play.*
T: I read the script and it's certainly short.
C: I have never done theatre before at all!
T: Why do you sound proud of that...? Well, I don't I have that much experience either.
T: Arimura-senpai-
T: -is there a need to ask?
M: Do you already know?
T: It's because you are famous. There was a commercial for Castella.
C: Eh!? Is that right!?
M: I was a child actor in a theatre troupe. That was a long time ago though.
C: If that is the case, there is no need to worry about anything!
C: Thank you for your guidance!
M: Yeah. The training period will be short, but if we are going to do it I want it to be a good performance.
M: I'll tell you as much as I can about what I've learned.
M: It's just...
C: Mao-senpai?
T: Are you worried about the cast by chance?
M: ...yeah, I am.

*__Flashback, outside a shrine__*

MS: ...so, for the casting, please follow this document!
M: Yes. ...Eh?
M: -I'm the hina doll?
MS: That's right! I've seen your commercial, so I'm hoping you will be the lead!
M: ...

*__Back in the training room__*

M: I played boy roles for in my theatre troupe for a long time, this will be my first time playing a girl.
M: In that sense, I might be starting off at the same level as you guys.
T: Um...should we recast the play?
M: No, it's what the staff wants. I'll give it a try.
M: [*thinking*] *A hina doll...the role of a cute girl, huh?*
M: ...

*__Later, in the hallway outside the training room__*

T: ...tomorrow is the real thing, huh?
T: I practiced for both the play and the live performance, so I think it will turn out properly...
C: Tsukimura-san, what did you do?
T: China, what are you doing here?
C: You left the training room with an anxious look on your face.
C: If you have anything you are concerned about, I would be happy to listen.
T: I'm not really good at the customer service portion of events like this...
C: -is that what you are worried about? I understand how you feel.
T: Is that so? That's surprising. You are good at that kind of thing.
C: Everyone says that, but honestly, I am not confident at all!
T: Why do you sound proud of that?
C: But if people believe I have that kind of power-
C: I want to use it to support you.
C: After all, we are friends!
T: ...thank you, China.
C: We are in the same boat.
C: I am sure I will need your help as well.
C: At that time-
T: I will definitely help you.
C: Yes!
