*__Backstage__*

Management Staff: Good job! Wow, it was a great play!
T: Of course it was.
MS: The cast changes between the morning and afternoon shows; I was a bit worried when I first heard about it,
MS: but both roles were done perfectly! Even though it was a last minute change, the students of Hatsuboshi Academy were amazing.
C: It was a good idea!
MS: That's right and the customers were happy with the surprise difference from the morning show!
M: Thank you very much for accepting the sudden proposal of the change.
MS: No, no, it's was fine! I am looking forward to the live performance after this!

C: W-well, it is finally finished~...
M: Fufu, thanks to your suggestion, it's been a while since I've last been been in a play this fun.
M: Being treated like a princess once in a while isn't bad. 
C: But, I ended up holding both of you back...
T: In fact, it was the same for me. I made a few mistakes too...
T: It worked out in the end because Arimura-senpai stepped in.
C: Was it really a good performance...?
M: There is no need to worry. Don't you remember the faces of the audience?
C: ...!
C: They were laughing and having so much fun!
M: If so, then it's fine. It's not the number of mistakes that determines the outcome.
T: ...but I think that is only thank to you, Arimura-senapi.
M: That's no true. Theatre is something that everyone there creates.
M: There were certainly scenes where I followed your lead-
M: There were times where the innocent brilliance of you two supported me.
M: With everyone's help, we made it good. Thank you.
M: Thank to you guys, it reminded me of when I first joined my theatre troupe.
T: ...

*__Outside the shrine__*

C: Waa, there are so many people in the audience...!
M: Maybe it's because of the success of the play? The last performance is almost here.
T: No matter how many people are in the audience, all that's left is to do what you need to do.
M: I agree. What Temari said is right.
M: China, are you ready?
C: I am in top form! My fatigue from the performing in the play has already gone away!
T: Arimura-senpai, can I ask you one thing?
M: Yes, what's up?
T: You said you remembered the feelings you had when you first joined the theatre troupe.
T: Is that-
M: It's us wanting the audience to enjoy themselves as much as possible.
M: It's how I first started. Of course, I'm not an actor right now.
M: The place I want to shine next is the place we are heading towards right now.
T: Then, you can't make any mistakes.
C: Mao-senpai! Tsukimura-san! It's about time!
M: Got it. -let's go, Temari. It's your time to shine.
T: yes! ...Arimura-senpai.
M: What is it?
T: I'll be relying on you.
M: Fufu. If that's the case, I can't show you any weakness.

*__Backstage__*

MS: Thank you for today! East as much as you like!
M: I-it's a spectacular spread...
C: So much food I never see at home...
T: [*thinking*] *M-meat...sushi, ramen, tonkastu, hamburgers...*
T: [*thinking*] *No, no. Self-control, self-control... I'll just have salad today.*
C: Oh? Tsukimura-senapi, is only having a salad okay?
T: I'm an idol, that's why.
C: We did a good job. Maybe for today it is okay to have a bit more?
T: Y-you think so?
C: Yes! It's what you call a "cheat day"!
T: Then, then...just a little bit.
T: [*eating*] Munch...munch...
T: Um, can I have another one of these?
C: D-do not eat too much~!!
T: Hahaha...it's fine.
