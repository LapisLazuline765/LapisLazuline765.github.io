*__Backstage__*

M: "Ah, my Emperor. What are you doing here?" ...fufu.
T: [*walks over*] -Arimura-senpai, this is where you were.
M: ...Temari. Were you looking for me? Sorry, I was checking the script.
M: I thought it might be a good idea to add in some ad libs. What do you think, Temari?
T: Um, Arimura-senpai...
T: I thought so...you wanted to play the role of the Emperor, right
M: ...-
M: ...well, that's right.
M: When I first heard about there being a play, there's no doubt that was the role I was hoping for.
M: But, that is not what was requested and it's our job to do this properly.
M: Now that I have accepted the job, I will do it properly.
T: Arimura-senpai, is that okay with you?
M: ...ah, you are concerned for me, it makes me happy-
M: It's okay.
M: Temari is the Emperor and I am the hina doll, so let's put on a good performance.
T: ...yes!
T: Umm, Arimura-senpai.
M: ...yes?
T: I'm better at singing that anyone else, but I'm not very confident with acting-
T: If there is any tricks, can you teach them to me?
M: ...yes, that is fine with me.
M: You have already memorized you lines, right?
T: Yes, everything is memorized.
M: Fufu, as expected. Well then, stand there.
M: With my experience as a child actor, I'll teach you as much as I can.

*__Later__*

T: "Ah! What has happened! The hina doll's neck is aaahh-"
M: You are still embarrassed. Give up any shame you have. Now try again.
T: "Ahhhhhh! The hina doll's neck is ahhhhhhhhhhh!"
M: That's great. You have good posture, so the movements you make are beautiful.
M: Next up is how to walk. Don't put too much effort into it, try walking naturally.
T: [*walks around*] L-like this?
M: ..it's hard. Look closely at the way I walk. [*walks around*]
T: ...amazing. It's completely different from mine...!
M: Well, give it a try. Yes, that's good. Just like that.

*__Later__*

T: [*breathing heavily*] Haa, Haa...ah. Thank you very much!
M: Fufu, you are welcome.
M: Anyway, I'm surprised. You learn really quickly.
M: If you practice hard enough, you will be able to book work as an actor. I believe it.
T: Does that mean I also have talent as an actor?
M: ...Eh?
M: Ah, that's right. The mentality you have is good for actors.
T: A cool idol who also works as an actor. ...yes, that might not be too bad.
M: You are taller than me, I think you would look great on stage.
T: Arimura-senpai...
M: ...?
T: ...I, after all, I would have like to seen you play the Emperor.
M: Temari...
T: Because you have so much passion for the theatre-
T: And you also know how to play the role of men.
T: If you were the Emperor, I think the audience would enjoy that too.
T: Oh, but I think you playing the hina doll is cute too...
M: No, I'm-
C: [*walks over*] Fufufu... I've heard the whole thing!
M: ...China?
T: S-Since when did you start listening!?
C: When the two of you started practicing, I have been watching for a long time!
C: I think Temari's Emperor is good.
C: But I really want to see Mao-senpai's Emperor.
C: That is why, I thought-
C: It would be better to reverse it!
M: ...reverse it? 
C: Yes. During the practice earlier, you remembered all the Emperor's line.
M: ...well, just in case. You never know what will happen on the day of a performance.
C: Tsukimura-san, you also remembered the lines of the hina doll, right?
T: Well, if something happened, I would be able to play that part too.
M: Was it to replace me?
T: W-well, there aren't that many lines...
C: If that is the case, you can reverse the casting in the morning and afternoon shows.
T: Ah, that's what reversing it meant.
C: Tsukimura-san can be the hina doll in the afternoon, if you can memorize the lines perfectly by then-
T: ...I can. After all, I'm an actress.
C: So, there is no problem then.
C: It is a great was to create a buzz and the audience will enjoy it as well!
M: W-wait! Is it okay to decide that kind of thing on your own?
C: The staff said we can do as we please to a certain extent-
C: I will deal with the management!
T: Fufu, we will trust you, bonkotsu.
C: Fufu, just leave it to me!
T: So then, it's decided-
T: ...Arimura-senpai, can you show me the model for the Imperial Palace?
C: ...got it. Thank you Termari, China.
