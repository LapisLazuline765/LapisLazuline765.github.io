*__In a classroom__*

__Ume:__ Hey, hey, China-chan.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what is it?

__Ume:__ The day after tomorrow is Valentine's Day; China-chan, are you giving chocolate to someone?

__China:__ Ufufu, this year I am-<br />
__China:__ Going to give handmade chocolate to my grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh, China-chan is making it?

__China:__ Last year the maids in the mansion helped me...<br />
__China:__ This year, I'm going to make it on my own, I will surprise grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh~, China-chan, that's great.

__China:__ Not that great~.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what will you be doing this year?

__Ume:__ Fufu, As for me...Onee-chan!

__China:__ Ufufu...just as I thought.

__Ume:__ Every year, Onee-chan and I make chocolates and exchange them!

__China:__ Oh, so that's how it is!

__China:__ [*doing an impression of Saki*] "Ume, let's compete to see whose chocolate is more delicious!"

__Ume:__ China-chan, that's not like her at all~.<br />
__Ume:__ We used to compete in the past, but don't anymore.<br />
__Ume:__ My sister is teaching me now.

__Misuzu:__ ...fufu, what are both of you talking about?

__China:__ Hayate-san. Valentine's day is the day after tomorrow. We were discussing that.

__Misuzu:__ Valentine's, huh.

__Ume:__ Will Misuzu-chan give chocolates to anyone?

__Misuzu:__ When I was in middle school, the members of the unit I was in exchanged chocolate.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan refused at first because she thought it would make her fat, but...<br />
__Misuzu:__ ...every year, she received it properly.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan also secretly put chocolate in my shoe locker...fufu.

__Ume:__ Eh, why in the shoe locker!?

*__In the library__*

__Librarian:__ Yes, how can I help you? ...Eeeh!?

__Hiro:__ Books on how to make chocolate, I'll take all of them.<br />
__Hiro:__ "Western Confectionery Encyclopedia", "Professional Techniques"...

__Librarian:__ Will you really take all of them? There are more than 30 books here.

__Hiro:__ I'm good at reading books.

__Librarian:__ No, that is not really the issue... Can you carry all of them?

__Hiro:__ ...fufu, leave it to me.<br />
__Hiro:__ [*struggling to lift the books*] ....nn....n...nnnnnn....!

__Librarian:__ Eh? W-wait, are you really okay!?

__Hiro:__ It was impossible.<br />
__Hiro:__ I'll just read it here after all.
