*__In the school lobby__*

__Temari__: The place I was suppose to meet Arimura-senpai, it's here, right...?

__China__: [*walks in*] Oh, Tsukimura-san?

__Temari__: China, what are you doing here?

__China__: I talked with Mao-senpai and she asked me to meet her here.

__Temari__: I see. It's the same for me.

__China__: Well, the same for you too. Me, Tsukimura-senpai, and Mao-senpai...<br />
__China__: It is an unusual combination. I wonder what she has planned...?

__Temari__: Well...she said we would meet and talk about the details...

__Mao__: [*walks in*] Sorry for suddenly asking you two to meet.

__China__: Ah, Mao-senpai!

__Temari__: ...Hello. Why did you want to talk to China and I today?

__Mao__: Actually, there is a local Hinamatsuri festival event you will be participating in.

__China__: That is...as a job, right?

__Mao__: Yes. A request was received by Hatsuboshi Academy, I will be participating as well.<br />
__Mao__: The job includes assisting the executive committee, serving as a reporter at the venue, and taking photographs with customers.<br />
__Mao__: At the end, there will also be a live performance.

__China__: Wow...! A live performance from Mao-senpai; I am looking forward to it!

__Temari__: What are you talking about, China? We will also be performing.

__China__: Ehh!?

__Mao__: Yes. Just like Temari says, I want you guys to perform too.<br />
__Mao__: It seems the request was for three idols.

__China__: I-is it okay for me to do it?<br />
__China__: I know I am saying it about myself, but I am a bit slow.

__Temari__: It's different now, right? Be more confident.

__China__: Ehh!?<br />
__China__: I'm glad you say that, but...

__Mao__: You guys are good. That's why I recommended you.

__China__: You recommended me...!?

__Mao__: I thought China would be suitable for this kind of event.<br />
__Mao__: Just having China there will make everyone smile.

__China__: I have that kind of power...?

__Temari__: ...yes. I thought so too. You have that kind of talent.<br />
__Temari__: That was the case for Halloween as well.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *She saved me too...*

__China__: I cannot believe Tsukimura-san is praising me so much...!
__China__: I feel like I can do it!

__Temari__: ...regardless of China, why did you choose me?

__Mao__: You can do a live performance at a big event venue.<br />
__Mao__: Most of the people who will be coming to the festival probably will not know about us.<br />
__Mao__: If we are going to do this, we want to live an impression, right?<br />
__Mao__: I think I need your singing to do that. Will you help me?

__Temari__: ...if that's the case.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *I'm looking forward to it so much!*

__Mao__: Thank you, Temari. What do you think about it, China?

__China__: Of course, I will help you out as well!

__Mao__: Okay, let's liven up Hinamatsuri together!

*__Temari & China__*: Yes!






















*__In a classroom__*

__Ume:__ Hey, hey, China-chan.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what is it?

__Ume:__ The day after tomorrow is Valentine's Day; China-chan, are you giving chocolate to someone?

__China:__ Ufufu, this year I am-<br />
__China:__ Going to give handmade chocolate to my grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh, China-chan is making it?

__China:__ Last year the maids in the mansion helped me...<br />
__China:__ This year, I'm going to make it on my own, I will surprise grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh~, China-chan, that's great.

__China:__ Not that great~.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what will you be doing this year?

__Ume:__ Fufu, As for me...Onee-chan!

__China:__ Ufufu...just as I thought.

__Ume:__ Every year, Onee-chan and I make chocolates and exchange them!

__China:__ Oh, so that's how it is!

__China:__ [*doing an impression of Saki*] "Ume, let's compete to see whose chocolate is more delicious!"

__Ume:__ China-chan, that's not like her at all~.<br />
__Ume:__ We used to compete in the past, but don't anymore.<br />
__Ume:__ My sister is teaching me now.

__Misuzu:__ ...fufu, what are both of you talking about?

__China:__ Hayate-san. Valentine's day is the day after tomorrow. We were discussing that.

__Misuzu:__ Valentine's, huh.

__Ume:__ Will Misuzu-chan give chocolates to anyone?

__Misuzu:__ When I was in middle school, the members of the unit I was in exchanged chocolate.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan refused at first because she thought it would make her fat, but...<br />
__Misuzu:__ ...every year, she received it properly.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan also secretly put chocolate in my shoe locker...fufu.

__Ume:__ Eh, why in the shoe locker!?

*__Outside of the classroom__*

__Hiro:__ [*listening in*] Valentine's...<br />
__Hiro:__ ...!

*__In the library__*

__Librarian:__ Yes, how can I help you? ...Eeeh!?

__Hiro:__ Books on how to make chocolate, I'll take all of them.<br />
__Hiro:__ "Western Confectionery Encyclopedia", "Professional Techniques"...

__Librarian:__ Will you really take all of them? There are more than 30 books here.

__Hiro:__ I'm good at reading books.

__Librarian:__ No, that is not really the issue... Can you carry all of them?

__Hiro:__ ...fufu, leave it to me.<br />
__Hiro:__ [*struggling to lift the books*] ....nn....n...nnnnnn....!

__Librarian:__ Eh? W-wait, are you really okay!?

__Hiro:__ It was impossible.<br />
__Hiro:__ I'll just read it here after all.

*__Later in the library__*

__Hiro:__ ...Whew. I almost got it. All that's left to do is make it according to theory.

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Hiro:__ ...-<br />
__Hiro:__ ...why did this happen?<br />
__Hiro:__ ...fufu, I can't help it.

__Rinami:__ [*walks in the lunchroom*] Hmm? What is that scorching smell...?<br />
__Rinami:__ [*walks towards the communal kitchen*] Is anyone there?

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Rinami:__ Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
