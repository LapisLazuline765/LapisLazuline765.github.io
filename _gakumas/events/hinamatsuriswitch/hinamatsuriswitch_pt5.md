*__Backstage__*

__Management Staff__: Good job! Wow, it was a great play!

__Temari__: Of course it was.

__Management Staff__: The cast changes between the morning and afternoon shows; I was a bit worried when I first heard about it,<br />
__Management Staff__: but both roles were done perfectly! Even though it was a last minute change, the students of Hatsuboshi Academy were amazing.

__China__: It was a good idea!

__Management Staff__: That's right and the customers were happy with the surprise difference from the morning show!

__Mao__: Thank you very much for accepting the sudden change proposal.

__Management Staff__: No, no, it's was fine! I am looking forward to the live performance after this!

*__Outside the shrine__*

__China__: W-well, it is finally finished~...

__Mao__: Fufu, thanks to your suggestion, it's been a while since I've have this much fun in a play.

__Mao__: Being treated like a princess once in a while isn't bad. 

__China__: But, I ended up holding both of you back...

__Temari__: In fact, it was the same for me. I made a few mistakes too...<br />
__Temari__: It worked out in the end because Arimura-senpai got us back on track.

__China__: Was it really a good performance...?

__Mao__: There is no need to worry. Don't you remember the faces of the audience?

__China__: ...!<br />
__China__: They were laughing and having so much fun!

__Mao__: If so, then it's fine. It's not the number of mistakes that determines the outcome.

__Temari__: ...but I think that is only thank to you, Arimura-senapi.

__Mao__: That's not true. Theatre is something that everyone there creates.<br />
__Mao__: There were certainly scenes where I followed your lead-<br />
__Mao__: There were times where the innocent brilliance of you two supported me.<br />
__Mao__: With everyone's help, we made it good. Thank you.<br />
__Mao__: Thank to you all, it reminded me of when I first joined my theatre troupe.

__Temari__: ...

*__Just before the live performance__*

*__Outside the shrine__*

__China__: Waa, there are so many people in the audience...!

__Mao__: Maybe it's because of the success of the play? Our last performance is almost here.

__Temari__: No matter how many people are in the audience, all that's left is to do what you need to do.

__Mao__: I agree. What Temari said is right.<br />
__Mao__: China, are you ready?

__China__: I am in top form! My fatigue from performing in the play earlier has already gone away!

__Temari__: Arimura-senpai, can I ask you one thing?

__Mao__: Yes, what's up?

__Temari__: You said you remembered the feelings you had when you first joined the theatre troupe.<br />
__Temari__: Is that-

__Mao__: It's us wanting the audience to enjoy themselves as much as possible.<br />
__Mao__: It's how I first started. Of course, I'm not an actor right now.<br />
__Mao__: The place we are about to go to is the place I want to shine next.

__Temari__: Then, you can't make any mistakes.

__China__: Mao-senpai! Tsukimura-san! It is about time!

__Mao__: Got it. -let's go, Temari. It's your time to shine.

__Temari__: yes! ...Arimura-senpai.

__Mao__: What is it?

__Temari__: I'll be relying on you.

__Mao__: Fufu. If that's the case, I can't show you any weakness.

*__After the live performance__*

*__Backstage__*

__Management Staff__: Thank you for today! East as much as you like!

__Mao__: I-it's a spectacular spread...

__China__: So much food I never see at home...

__Temari__: [*thinking*] *M-meat...sushi, ramen, tonkastu, hamburgers...*<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *No, no. Self-control, self-control... I'll just have salad today.*

__China__: Oh? Tsukimura-senapi, is only having a salad okay?

__Temari__: I'm an idol, that's why.

__China__: We did a good job. Maybe just for today it is okay to have a bit more?

__Temari__: Y-you think so?

__China__: Yes! It's what you call a "cheat day"!

__Temari__: Then, then...just a little bit.

__Temari__: [*eating*] Munch...munch...<br />
__Temari__: Um, can I have another one of these?

__China__: D-do not eat too much~!!

__Mao__: Hahaha...it's fine.
