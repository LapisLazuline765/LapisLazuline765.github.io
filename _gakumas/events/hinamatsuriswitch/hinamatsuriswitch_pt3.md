*__Day of the Hinamatsuri festival__*

*__Outside the shrine__*

__China__: Nice to me you all!<br />
__China__: I am China Kuramoto from Hasuboshi Academy and I will be your reporter today!<br />
__China__: Please take a look! There is already a crowd of people!<br />
__China__: The hina dolls are all lined up. It is spectacular~!!<br />
__China__: Now, let us talk to the executive committee. I would like to ashk-<br />
__China__: -Ahh!? I bit my tongue!<br />

__Mao__: -I agree. I am also surprised by the energy of the locals.<br />
__Mao__: We will do our best to live up to that enthusiasm.

__China__: Thank you, Mao-senpai! I will do my best as well!<br />
__China__: Now, onto the next question! ...umm, huh? Umm...

__Mao__: I'm sure it was about the play...right?

__China__: T-that is right!<br />

__Mao__: [*whispering*] China, should you take a deep breath? I can take care of the question.

__China__: Y-yes!<br />
__China__: [*breathes in*] [*breathes out*] [*breathes in*] [*breathes out*]

*__Later, outside the shrine__*

__China__: I-I am tired... It was exhausting~...<br />
__China__: ..o-oh? Is that Tsukimura-san over there?

__Fan__: Um, you are Temari-chan, right...! I'm a fan of yours!

__Temari__: Is...is that right? Thanks.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *Wow! I'm so happy! I can't believe they called out to me...!*

__Fan__: The other day when I saw Hatsuboshi Academy's live performance, I thought you were so cool...!

__Temari__: I see. I'm glad.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *Cool, they said~! I'm cool! Wow~!*

__Fan__: You sing very well, I thought you were amazing...!

__Temari__: [*nods*]

__Fan__: ...

__Temari__: ...umm, is there anything else?

__Fan__: It's...I'm sorry. You were annoyed that I called out to you.

__Temari__: Eh...?

__China__: [*walks over*] T-tsukimura-san!

__Temari__: China?

__China__: Why not take a picture together with them?

__Temari__: Well, what do you think?

__Fan__: I-is that okay!? please! Thank you so much!

*__Later__*

__Temari__: ...thanks, China.

__China__: I did not do anything.

__Temari__: I was so happy when they called out to me. Were my responses cold?

__China__: There is no need to worry.<br />
__China__: They left looking really happy.

__Temari__: I agree. Just by taking a photo with me...

__China__: That's right, I think they became an even bigger fan of yours.

__Temari__: [*nods*]

__China__: It is good!

__Temari__: Eh?

__China__: There has not been a fan that has called out to me!<br />
__China__: I have never been reached out to by fans!

__Temari__: [*smug*] Hmm. I have though.

__China__: I just saw that! It is frustrating~!<br />
__Temari__: Come to think of it, where is Arimura-senpai?
