*__Outside a shrine__*

__China__: Oh~! So this is the venue for the festival!

__Temari__: China, don't get too work up. Remember we are here for work.

__China__: Ah! That is right!<br />
__China__: The meeting for the Hinamatsuri festival should be done properly...!

__Temari__: That is correct.

__Mao__: [*thinking*] *Temari seemed to be worked up herself just a moment ago...<br />
__Mao__: ...ahem. It looks like they are in the middle of setting up the venue. Shall we look for management?

*__Later, outside the shrine__*

__China__: Eh!?

__Temari__: We...

__Mao__: ...will be in a play?

__Management Staff__: That's right! The play is based off the Hinamatsuri festival and it lasts at most 10 minutes!<br />
__Management Staff__: So? Will you all do it?

__Mao__: ...u-umm...there is not much time left until the festival, right?

__Management Staff__: Well~, it's a bit of a sudden request, but let's have fun with it.<br />
__Management Staff__: What do you think?

__Mao__:  ...we understand. We will do it.

*__Later, in the training room__*

__Mao__: [*thinking*] *...a play.*

__Temari__: I read the script and it's certainly short.

__China__: I have never done theatre before at all!

__Temari__: Why do you sound proud of that...? Well, I don't I have that much experience either.<br />
__Temari__: Arimura-senpai-<br />
__Temari__: -is there a need to ask?

__Mao__: Do you already know?

__Temari__: It's because you are famous. I remember a there was a commercial for Castella.

__China__: Eh!? Is that right!?

__Mao__: I was a child actor in a theatre troupe. That was a long time ago though.

__China__: If that is the case, there is no need to worry about anything!<br />
__China__: Thank you for your guidance!

__Mao__: Yeah. The training period will be short, but if we are going to do it I want to give a good performance.<br />
__Mao__: I'll tell you as much as I can about what I've learned.<br />
__Mao__: It's just...

__China__: Mao-senpai?

__Temari__: Are you worried about the cast by chance?

__Mao__: ...yeah, I am.

*__Flashback, outside the shrine__*

__Management Staff__: ...so, for the casting, please follow this document!

__Mao__: Yes. ...Eh?<br />
__Mao__: -I'm the hina doll?

__Management Staff__: That's right! I've seen your commercial, so I'm hoping you will be the lead!

__Mao__: ...

*__Back in the training room__*

__Mao__: I played boy roles for in my theatre troupe for a long time, this will be my first time playing a girl.<br />
__Mao__: In that sense, I might be starting off at the same level as you all.

__Temari__: Um...should we recast the play?

__Mao__: No, it's what the staff wants. I'll give it a try.<br />
__Mao__: [*thinking*] *A hina doll...the role of a cute girl, huh?*<br />
__Mao__: ...

*__Later, in the hallway outside the training room__*

__Temari__: ...tomorrow is the real thing, huh?<br />
__Temari__: I practiced for both the play and the live performance, so I think it will turn out properly...

__China__: Tsukimura-san, how are you?

__Temari__: China, what are you doing here?

__China__: You left the training room with an anxious look on your face.<br />
__China__: If you have anything you are concerned about, I would be happy to listen.

__Temari__: I'm not really good at the customer service portion of events like this...

__China__: -is that what you are worried about? I understand how you feel.

__Temari__: Is that so? That's surprising. You're good at that kind of thing.

__China__: Everyone says that, but honestly, I am not confident at all!

__Temari__: Why do you sound proud of that?

__China__: But if people believe I have that kind of power-<br />
__China__: I want to use it to support you.<br />
__China__: After all, we are friends!

__Temari__: ...thank you, China.

__China__: We are in the same boat.<br />
__China__: I am sure I will need your help as well.<br />
__China__: At that time-

__Temari__: I will definitely help you.

__China__: Yes!
