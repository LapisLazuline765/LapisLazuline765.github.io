*__In the school lobby__*

__Temari__: The place I was suppose to meet Arimura-senpai, it's here, right...?

__China__: [*walks over*] Oh, Tsukimura-san?

__Temari__: China, what are you doing here?

__China__: I talked with Mao-senpai and she asked me to meet her here.

__Temari__: I see. It's the same for me.

__China__: The same for you too. Me, Tsukimura-senpai, and Mao-senpai...<br />
__China__: It is an unusual combination. I wonder what she has planned...?

__Temari__: Well...she said we would meet and talk about the details...

__Mao__: [*walks over*] Sorry for suddenly asking you two to meet.

__China__: Ah, Mao-senpai!

__Temari__: ...Hello. Why did you want to talk to China and I today?

__Mao__: Actually, there is a local Hinamatsuri festival event we have been asked to participate in.

__China__: That is...as a job, right?

__Mao__: Yes. A request was received by Hatsuboshi Academy, I will be participating as well.<br />
__Mao__: The job includes assisting the executive committee, serving as a reporter at the venue, and taking photographs with customers.<br />
__Mao__: At the end, there will also be a live performance.

__China__: Wow...! A live performance from Mao-senpai; I am looking forward to it!

__Temari__: What are you talking about, China? We will also be performing.

__China__: Ehh!?

__Mao__: Yes. Just like Temari says, I want you all to perform too.<br />
__Mao__: It seems the request was for three idols.

__China__: I-is it okay for me to do it?<br />
__China__: I know I am saying it about myself, but I am a bit slow.

__Temari__: It's different now, right? Be more confident.

__China__: Ehh!?<br />
__China__: I'm glad you say that, but...

__Mao__: You all are good. That's why I recommended you.

__China__: You recommended me...!?

__Mao__: I thought China would be suitable for this kind of event.<br />
__Mao__: Just having China there will make everyone smile.

__China__: I have that kind of power...?

__Temari__: ...yes. I thought so too. You have that kind of talent.<br />
__Temari__: That was the case for Halloween as well.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *She saved me back then too...*

__China__: I cannot believe Tsukimura-san is praising me so much...!
__China__: I feel like I can do it!

__Temari__: ...regardless of China, why did you choose me?

__Mao__: You can do a live performance at a big event venue.<br />
__Mao__: Most of the people who will be coming to the festival probably will not know about us.<br />
__Mao__: If we are going to do this, we want to leave an impression, right?<br />
__Mao__: I believe I need your singing to do that. Will you help me?

__Temari__: ...if that's the case.<br />
__Temari__: [*thinking*] *I'm looking forward to it so much!*

__Mao__: Thank you, Temari. What do you think about it, China?

__China__: Of course, I will help you out as well!

__Mao__: Okay, let's liven up the Hinamatsuri festival together!

*__Temari & China__*: Yes!
