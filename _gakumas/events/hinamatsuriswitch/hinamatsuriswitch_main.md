#### Cultural Notes
----
+ There are sure a lot of onomatopoeias this time. [This website](https://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/index/a/) is very helpful if you want to learn more about Japanese to English onomatopoeia translations.
+ Hinamatsuri is often translated to Girl's Day and falls on March 3rd. I left it untranslated since it's a well known holiday. You can read more about the holiday [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinamatsuri).
