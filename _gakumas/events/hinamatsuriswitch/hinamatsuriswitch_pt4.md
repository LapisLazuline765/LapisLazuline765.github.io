*__Backstage__*

__Mao__: "Ah, my Empress. What are you doing here?" ...fufu.

__Temari__: [*walks over*] -Arimura-senpai, this is where you were.

__Mao__: ...Temari. Were you looking for me? Sorry, I was checking the script.<br />
__Mao__: I thought it might be a good idea to add in some ad libs. What do you think, Temari?

__Temari__: Um, Arimura-senpai...<br />
__Temari__: I thought so...you wanted to play the role of the Emperor, right?

__Mao__: ...-<br />
__Mao__: ...well, that's right.<br />
__Mao__: When I first heard about there being a play, there's no doubt that was the role I was hoping for.<br />
__Mao__: But, that is not what was requested and it's our job to do this properly.<br />
__Mao__: Now that I have accepted the job, I will do it.

__Temari__: Arimura-senpai, is that okay with you?

__Mao__: ...ah, you are concerned for me, it makes me happy-<br />
__Mao__: It's okay.<br />
__Mao__: Temari is the Emperor and I am the hina doll, so let's put on a good performance.

__Temari__: ...yes!<br />
__Temari__: Umm, Arimura-senpai.

__Mao__: ...yes?

__Temari__: I'm better at singing that anyone else, but I'm not very confident with acting-<br />
__Temari__: If there is any tricks, can you teach them to me?

__Mao__: ...yes, that is fine with me.

__Mao__: You have already memorized you lines, right?

__Temari__: Yes, everything is memorized.

__Mao__: Fufu, as expected. Well then, stand there.<br />
__Mao__: With my experience as a child actor, I'll teach you as much as I can.

*__Later__*

__Temari__: "Ah! What has happened! The hina doll's neck is aaahh-"

__Mao__: You are still embarrassed. Give up any shame you have. Now try again.

__Temari__: "Ahhhhhh! The hina doll's neck is ahhhhhhhhhhh!"

__Mao__: That's great. You have good posture, so the movements you make are beautiful.<br />
__Mao__: Next up is how to walk. Don't put too much effort into it, try walking naturally.

__Temari__: [*walks around*] L-like this?

__Mao__: ..it's hard. Look closely at the way I walk. [*walks around*]

__Temari__: ...amazing. It's completely different from mine...!

__Mao__: Well, give it a try. Yes, that's good. Just like that.

*__Later__*

__Temari__: [*breathing heavily*] Haa, Haa...ah. Thank you very much!

__Mao__: Fufu, you are welcome.<br />
__Mao__: Anyway, I'm surprised. You learn really quickly.<br />
__Mao__: If you practice hard enough, you will be able to book work as an actor. I believe that.

__Temari__: Does that mean I also have talent as an actor?

__Mao__: ...Eh?<br />
__Mao__: Ah, that's right. The mentality you have is good for actors.

__Temari__: A cool idol who also works as an actor. ...yes, that might not be too bad.

__Mao__: You are taller than me, I think you would look great on stage.

__Temari__: Arimura-senpai...

__Mao__: ...?

__Temari__: ...I, after all, I would have like to seen you play the Emperor.

__Mao__: Temari...

__Temari__: Because you have so much passion for the theatre-<br />
__Temari__: And you also know how to play the role of men.<br />
__Temari__: If you were the Emperor, I think the audience would enjoy that.<br />
__Temari__: Oh, but I think you playing the hina doll is cute too...

__Mao__: No, I'm-

__China__: [*walks over*] Fufufu... I've heard the whole thing!

__Mao__: ...China?

__Temari__: S-Since when have you been there!?

__China__: When the two of you started practicing, I have been watching for a long time!
__China__: I think Temari's Emperor is good.<br />
__China__: But I really want to see Mao-senpai's Emperor.<br />
__China__: That is why, I thought-<br />
__China__: It would be better to reverse it!

__Mao__: ...reverse it? 

__China__: Yes. During the practice earlier, you remembered all the Emperor's line.

__Mao__: ...well, just in case. You never know what will happen on the day of a performance.

__China__: Tsukimura-san, you also remembered the lines of the hina doll, right?

__Temari__: Well, if something happened, I would be able to play that part too.

__Mao__: Was it to replace me?

__Temari__: W-well, there aren't that many lines...

__China__: If that is the case, you can reverse the casting in the morning and afternoon shows.

__Temari__: Ah, that's what reversing it meant.

__China__: Tsukimura-san can be the hina doll in the afternoon, if you can memorize the lines perfectly by then-

__Temari__: ...I can. After all, I'm an actress.

__China__: So, there is no problem then.<br />
__China__: It is a great was to create a buzz and the audience will enjoy it as well!

__Mao__: W-wait! Is it okay to decide that kind of thing on your own?

__China__: The staff said we can do as we please to a certain extent-<br />
__China__: I will deal with the management!

__Temari__: Fufu, we will trust you.

__China__: Fufu, just leave it to me!

__Temari__: So then, it's decided-<br />
__Temari__: ...Arimura-senpai, can you show me how to model as the hina doll?

__China__: ...got it. Thank you Temari, China.
