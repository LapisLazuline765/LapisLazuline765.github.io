*__In the student council room__*

__Sena:__ ...to prepare for the Valentine's festival, I better check on this too.

__Rinami:__ Thank you for your hard work, President.

__Sena:__ Rinami. How is everything?

__Rinami:__ Actually, I have something I want to consult you about.

__Hiro:__ ...President?

__Sena:__ Oh, you are...a classmate of China and the others-

__Hiro:__ ...her friend.

__Sena:__ Fufu, a friend of a friend...Hiro Shinosawa.

__Hiro:__ Do you know me?

__Sena:__ Of course, you are a precious junior. And you are bit of a celebrity.

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Sena:__ Fufu, everyone remembers the names of the students in the idol department.

__Sena:__ The consultation, is it for Shinosawa-san?

__Hiro:__ I want you to tell me about chocolate.

__Rinami:__ What kind of chocolate would President be happy to receive on Valentine's Day?<br />
__Rinami:__ We want your advice. <br />
__Rinami:__ The president receives a lot from her juniors every year, right?

__Sena:__ Yes, I get so much there it is like mountain on the table.

__Rinami:__ President, what kind of chocolate would you be the most happy with?

__Sena:__ ...hmm. I would be happy with anything as long as they were thinking about me.<br />
__Sena:__ Handmade or not.

__Hiro:__ Same as Rinami.

__Rinami:__ T-that's true...

__Sena:__ Not limited to Valentine's, I think that gifts are an expression of love.

__Hiro:__ ...love.

__Sena:__ Yes. How much thought did you give the gift you are giving to a precious person.

__Sena:__ Chocolate can help you understand this; because of that, I would be happy.

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Sena:__ That's right, just now I was making chocolate.

__Rinami:__ Eh, the President was?

__Sena:__ Yes, it is still unfinished, but I will show it to you.

__Hiro:__ I want to use it as a reference.

*__Later, in the student council room__*

__Sena:__ Fufu, here it is.

__Rinami:__ Is it on your PC?

__Sena:__ Yes. It's still in the design stage, but the results are looking good.

__Rinami:__ ...!?<br />
__Rinami:__ Um, President. This is...

__Sena:__ A Kotone 3D model!

__Rinami:__ Eh!? W-what is this?

__Sena:__ I incorporated footage from the live performance and created a full CG model. <br />
__Sena:__ Once you have the model, using a 3D printer, you can make a choco Kotone.<br />
__Sena:__ I would like it to capture Kotone's most shining moment.<br />
__Sena:__ The detailed expression of her fingertips is very difficult.

__Rinami:__ D-do you plan on giving this to Kotone?

__Sena:__ I hope she will be happy with it.

__Hiro:__ ...I see. Love.<br />
__Hiro:__ I understand it now.

__Rinami:__ Hiro-chan!?

__Hiro:__ ...let me see that for a minute.

__Sena:__ Eh? Sure, go ahead.

__Hiro:__ [*types on the PC*] I think it will be better this way. If you change this value-

__Sena:__ ...You are amazing! The quality is rising.

__Hiro:__ The application of computational objects. I haven't done it much.

*__Later, in the school hallway__*

__Hiro:__ I was impressed.

__Rinami:__ Eh!?

__Hiro:__ I learned some very important things.<br />
__Hiro:__ The important thing is love. Love means- putting in effort.

__Rinami:__ Yes. That's, well, I don't think that's wrong, but...

__Hiro:__ I was naive.<br />
__Hiro:__ Just by reading the books packed with knowledge,<br />
__Hiro:__ I didn't take chocolate seriously.

__Rinami:__ Um, yes?

__Hiro:__ I should have thought more about the essence of chocolate.

__Rinami:__ So, what is the essence of chocolate?

__Hiro:__ -cacao beans.

__Rinami:__ Eh!?

__Hiro:__ To procure the best cacao beans-<br />
__Hiro:__ You have to go to Ghana. [*walks off*]

__Rinami:__ Wait a minute- Hiro-chan!? Hiro-chan!

*__A plan takes off in the distance__*
