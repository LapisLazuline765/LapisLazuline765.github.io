*__Day of the Valentine's festival__*

*__In the school lobby__*

__Rinami:__ Hmm, I'm glad it's sunny. It going to be busy today.<br />
__Rinami:__ Hiro-chan, when will you give your chocolate?

__Hiro:__ I can't figure out the best timing.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want to make it a surprise, but if I get the timing wrong-<br />
__Hiro:__ It would be bad.

__Rinami:__ ...yeah. That's difficult. You are putting a lot of thought into it.

__Sena:__ Good morning. Rinami, Shinosawa-san.

__Rinami:__ President, good morning.

__Sena:__ It will be a busy day today.<br />
__Sena:__ That's right, Shinosawa-san. I would like to thank you for the other day.

__Hiro:__ Thank me?

__Sena:__ Yes. Thank you for making the Choco Kotone 3D model so nice.<br />
__Sena:__ You are going to give your friends chocolate as a surprise, right?<br />
__Sena:__ Actually, on the festival stage, there happens to be some free time,<br />
__Sena:__ if it only takes about the time of one song, you might be able to use it.<br />
__Sena:__ Wouldn't it be a good surprise to give your chocolate along with a song?

__Hiro:__ ...song? It would be... An amazing surprise.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...but, is it really okay? It seems like an abuse of power.

__Sena:__ Isn't it okay to sometimes exercise the President's authority?<br />
__Sena:__ Also, I'm doing it for my dear junior.

__Hiro:__ ...thank you, President.

__Rinami:__ That's great. It's going to be a great surprise performance.<br />
__Rinami:__ President, come to think of it. Your chocolate, did you give it to Kotone-chan?

__Sena:__ I've been looking for her this morning, but I cannot seem to find her...<br />
__Sena:__ I'm busy hosting the festival today. It might be difficult to hand it over in person...

*__In the outdoor courtyard__*

__Ume:__ China-chan, here you go! [*hands over chocolate*]

__China:__ Ah, thank you very much! It is very cute.

__Ume:__ I made it with my sister. It's a completely nutritious food!

__China:__ You also thought about nutrition. What is in it?

__Ume:__ I wonder what it was. Garlic, ginseng, bean flour...

__China:__ Fufu, it sounds very nutritious.<br />
__China:__ As for myself, here you go. [*hands over chocolate*]

__Ume:__ Thank you, China-chan! I'll take my time eating it...hmm?

__China:__ What is wrong?

__Ume:__ I just got a message from Hiro-chan.

__China:__ Ah, so did I. Umm, "come to the front of the stage at 1pm"?

*__In the school lobby__*

__Temari:__ ...I don't need it. You know I'm cutting calories, right?

__Misuzu:__ Fufu, it's okay. It's really low in carbs...huh?

__Temari:__ What, what's wrong?

__Misuzu:__ I have to leave now. My friend is calling me. [*walks away*]

__Temari:__ Hey, wait, this chocolate....ahh.

*__Backstage__*

__Rinami:__ Hiro-chan, everyone has gathered.

__Hiro:__ ...yeah.

__Rinami:__ Good luck.

__Hiro:__ Rinami, thank you.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...it would be best if this goes smoothly.<br />
__Hiro:__ [*thinking*] *China, Ume, Misuzu, my precious friends.*<br />
__Hiro:__ [*thinking*] *These feelings of thanks, I'll use them to sing a lot-* [*Hiro walks out on stage*]

__Hiro:__ Everyone, thank you for coming.

__Hiro:__ I worked hard.

__Ume:__ ...hmm, what is it?

__Hiro:__ [*hands over chocolate*] ...ta-da, surprise.

__Ume:__ ...chocolate? Hiro-chan made this!?

__Hiro:__ Fufu, friend chocolate. I did my best. I was helped by Rinami though.

__Rinami:__ Hiro-chan made it from cacao beans.

__China:__ Ehh, you can do that?

__Misuzu:__ Me too, mine is also handmade from cacao beans...

__Hiro:__ ...for four hours I grinded. I thought my arms would break.

__China:__ [*paintful noises*] Hiii~...

__Ume:__ ...Hiro-chan, thank you. I'm so happy!

__Hiro:__ Fufu...thank goodness.

__Misuzu:__ Shinosawa-san, thank you very much. This is from me... [*hands over chocolate*]

__China:__ Ah, that's right!

___Ume & China:__ Here, friend chocolate. [*hands over chocolate*]

__Hiro:__ ...-<br />
__Hiro:__ ...everyone, thank you.

*__Later in the dorm hallway__*

__Kotone:__ Whew, I'm home-. Work, work..ah.

__Sena:__ Ah, Kotone. A package arrived in front of your room.

__Kotone:__ Luggage? What is it... Hm, a cooler...?<br />
__Kotone:__ Ugyaaaaaaa---------------!
