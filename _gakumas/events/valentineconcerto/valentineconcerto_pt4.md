*__In the school hallway__*

__Hiro:__ ...I noticed a fatal flaw.<br />
__Hiro:__ If I left for Ghana now, I wouldn't be able to make it back in time for Valentine's day.

__Rinami:__ Yes, that's right.

__Hiro:__ Although it's only 3rd in cacao production, Indonesia is closer.<br />
__Hiro:__ [*looks at phone*] What are the flight times leaving from Japan... 

__Rinami:__ W-wait, wait!<br />
__Rinami:__ There are classes and lessons that would be hard to take while you are away.

__Hiro:__ ...that's true.

__Rinami:__ No matter what, do you want to make it from cacao beans?

__Hiro:__ Yes. I do.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want to surprise by friends by making it myself.

__Rinami:__ ...Oh, hmm, is that right?...<br />
__Rinami:__ Ah, that's right. I wonder if you can get them from a department store this time of year?<br />
__Rinami:__ I've seen them for sale at the special Valentine's display.

__Hiro:__ ...a department store. It's not Ghana, do you think it would be okay?

__Rinami:__ Probably. The ones you find in the department store are most likely from Ghana.

__Hiro:__ ...then, it's okay.<br />
__Hiro:__ Rinami, I have a request.

__Rinami:__ ...yes?

__Hiro:__ I want to go to the store together.

__Rinami:__ ...sure, let's go together.

*__Later, outside of the dorms__*

__Rinami:__ ...phew. I'm glad they sold cacao beans.

__Hiro:__ ...it was very heavy.

__Rinami:__ Good work. You did your best.

__Hiro:__ If you hadn't helped me take half, I wouldn't have been able to make it back.<br />
__Hiro:__ You're a lifesaver.

__Rinami:__ You're exaggerating.<br />
__Rinami:__ As for the chocolate, are you sure you don't want any help?

__Hiro:__ Yes. I want to do it myself.

__Rinami:__ Yeah, I understand.
__Rinami:__ Then, if you have anymore trouble, feel free to ask me.

__Hiro:__ ...thank you.

*__The next day, in the communal kitchen__*

__Hiro:__ ...fufu, good.<br />
__Hiro:__ First, thoroughly wash the cacao beans. Over and over again until the water is no longer cloudy...<br />
__Hiro:__ Wipe off the moisture- and fry in the frying pan.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...u-un...hot. Heavy...fufu...<br />
__Hiro:__ Phew, phew...phew...<br />
__Hiro:__ ...Peel the cacao skin. One bean at a time, carefully.<br />
__Hiro:__ Phew, phew...fufu, here is the hardest part...<br />
__Hiro:__ grind, while heating.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...ha, ha...my arm hurts...<br />
__Hiro:__ ...it hurts, it's painful...very fun.<br />

*__4 hours later__*

__Rinami:__ -chan, Hiro-chan!?

__Hiro:__ [*from the floor*] ...Ri, na mi...?

__Rinami:__ A-are you okay!? The palms of your hands are red!

__Hiro:__ Fufu, it was like hell. ...my arm doesn't move anymore.

__Rinami:__ Have you been working since this morning?

__Hiro:__ Yeah, but I've only made a little.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...try some.

__Rinami:__ Yes, well then...hmm...

__Hiro:__ After all that, is it delicious?

__Rinami:__ Well, that's...

__Hiro:__ It's gritty.

__Rinami:__ ...-

__Hiro:__ I didn't have enough strength to grind it. ...it's a failure.<br />
__Hiro:__ It was fun to make, but this isn't good. I won't be able to make them happy.<br />
__Hiro:__ ...Rinami, I have a request.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want to make chocolate together.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want to give delicious chocolate to my dear friends.<br />

__Rinami:__ ...Hiro-chan.<br />
__Rinami:__ Yes, let's make it together.

*__Later, in the communal kitchen__*

__Hiro:__ ...it's done.

__Rinami:__ Yes. We are done. The size is a little smaller, though.<br />
__Rinami:__ It looks and tastes perfect.

__Hiro:__ Rinami, thank you!<br />
__Hiro:__ What's this feeling? It's different than usual.

__Rinami:__ ...?

__Hiro:__ Normally, if I can do something, I feel empty...<br />
__Hiro:__ ...but this time it was fun.
